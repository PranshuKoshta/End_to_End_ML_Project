# End-to-End Machine Learning Project: Student Performance Indicator

## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end machine learning application designed to **predict student performance test scores** based on various influencing factors [1]. It follows industry-standard best practices for building **modular, well-structured data science projects** from development to deployment [2].

The project covers essential stages of a machine learning lifecycle, including **data ingestion, data transformation, model training, evaluation, and deployment** [1, 2]. It also incorporates crucial aspects like **environment management, version control, exception handling, and logging** for robust and maintainable code [2].

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to understand how student performance test scores are **affected by variables** such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental Level of Education, Lunch type, and Test Preparation Course completion [1]. The project aims to **predict the test score** based on these features [1].

The dataset used consists of **1000 rows and 8 columns**, including both categorical and numerical features [3].

## Project Structure

The project follows a **modular and component-based architecture** to ensure code reusability and maintainability [2, 4]. The main source code resides in the `src` folder [5].

The key directories and files within `src` are:

*   **`components`**: Contains distinct modules for each stage of the ML lifecycle [2, 6].
    *   `data_ingestion.py`: Handles reading the data from a source (initially CSV, planned for databases), splitting it into train and test sets, and saving the data [2, 7, 8].
    *   `data_transformation.py`: Contains code for data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering, including handling missing values, categorical encoding, and scaling numerical features [2, 7, 9, 10].
    *   `model_trainer.py`: Responsible for training various machine learning models, evaluating them, selecting the best model, and saving it [2, 9, 11].
*   **`pipeline`**: Contains scripts to orchestrate the workflow by calling the components [2, 4].
    *   `train_pipeline.py`: Script for running the entire training process from data ingestion to model training [4].
    *   `predict_pipeline.py`: Script for handling new data inputs, preprocessing them using the saved objects, and generating predictions [2, 4, 12].
*   **`exception.py`**: Implements a **custom exception handling mechanism** to provide detailed error messages including script name and line number [2, 4, 13].
*   **`logger.py`**: Sets up a **logging configuration** to record execution flow and errors into a log file [2, 4, 14].
*   **`utils.py`**: Contains **reusable utility functions** for common tasks like saving and loading Python objects (models, preprocessors) [2, 4].
*   **`__init__.py`**: Present in package directories (like `src`, `components`, `pipeline`) to allow Python to recognize them as packages and enable imports [4-6, 15].

Other important files at the root level:

*   **`setup.py`**: Used to build the entire application as a **Python package**, allowing easy installation and distribution [15-18].
*   **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the necessary Python libraries and dependencies required for the project [15, 16, 19].
*   **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories (like `venv`, `artifacts`) that should be ignored by Git and not committed to the repository [15, 20, 21].
*   **`.ebextensions/python.config`**: Configuration file required for **AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment**, specifying the application entry point [15, 22].
*   **`application.py`**: The entry point file for the web application deployment on AWS Elastic Beanstalk (copy of `app.py` renamed for deployment) [15, 23].
*   **`app.py`**: Contains the Flask application code for the web interface [12].
*   **`notebook/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for initial Data Exploration (EDA) and model experimentation [24, 25].
    *   `data/student.csv`: The raw dataset file [24].
    *   `EDA.ipynb`: Notebook demonstrating the initial Exploratory Data Analysis [24].
    *   `Model Training.ipynb`: Notebook demonstrating initial model training and evaluation [24].
*   **`artifacts/`**: Directory created during the data ingestion and transformation process to store processed data and trained model/preprocessor objects [8, 15, 21].

## Setup and Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd ml_projects # or your project folder name
    ```
    *(Note: The source used 'ml_projects' initially, but the GitHub repo shown later was 'ml_project' [19, 35]. Use the actual repo name).*

2.  **Set up a Virtual Environment**:
    Using Conda is recommended [30]. Open your Anaconda Prompt or terminal.
    Navigate to the project directory [30].
    Create a new Conda environment with Python 3.8 [15]:
    ```bash
    conda create -p venv python=3.8 -y
    ```
    Activate the environment [15]:
    ```bash
    conda activate venv
    ```
    *(The `venv` directory will be created inside your project folder [30]).*

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Install the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file [16]:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: If you have `pip install -e .` or `-e src` in your `requirements.txt`, it's recommended to **comment or remove that line** for initial dependency installation to avoid building the package prematurely [3, 18]).*

4.  **Install the Project as a Package**:
    The project is structured to be installable as a Python package using `setup.py` [16]. From the project root directory, run:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
    *(The `-e` flag installs the package in "editable" mode, meaning changes to the source code are reflected without reinstallation).*

## Usage

### Running Components Individually (for testing/development)

You can test individual components or scripts. For example, to test the logger [36]:
```bash
python src/logger.py

To test the exception handling [35]:
python src/exception.py

Running the Training Pipeline
The training pipeline orchestrates the data ingestion, transformation, and model training steps. You would typically have a main script (like run_training.py or integrate this into train_pipeline.py) to execute this.
Conceptual flow of the training pipeline:
1.
Initiate Data Ingestion: Reads data, performs train-test split, saves raw and split data to artifacts/data [8, 15].
2.
Initiate Data Transformation: Reads split data, builds preprocessing pipeline, transforms train/test data, saves the preprocessor object (preprocessor.pickle) to artifacts/preprocessor [15, 37].
3.
Initiate Model Trainer: Takes transformed data, trains multiple models, evaluates them, performs hyperparameter tuning, selects the best model, and saves it (model.pickle) to artifacts/model [15, 27, 38].
Running the Prediction Pipeline (Web Application)
The project includes a simple Flask web application (app.py) to demonstrate the prediction pipeline [12].
1.
Ensure you have run the training pipeline at least once to generate the necessary model.pickle and preprocessor.pickle files in the artifacts folder.
2.
Run the Flask application from the project root directory:
python app.py  
3.
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (or the address shown in the console).
4.
You should see a home page (potentially with a form to input student data based on home.html) [39].
5.
Submitting the form will trigger the prediction pipeline (/predict route in app.py) [39, 40].
Deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
The project can be deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk [22].
1.
Prerequisites:
◦
An AWS account [41].
◦
AWS CLI configured locally (optional, but helpful).
2.
Configuration for Elastic Beanstalk:
◦
A .ebextensions folder is created at the root of the project [22].
◦
Inside .ebextensions, a python.config file is created to specify the WSGI path for the application [22, 23]. This file tells Elastic Beanstalk where to find your Flask application's entry point.
◦
The entry point is configured to be application:application, where the first application refers to the application.py file and the second application refers to the Flask application instance within that file [23].
◦
For deployment, the app.py code is copied into application.py, and the debug=True setting is removed [23, 31]. The original app.py might be deleted or ignored for deployment purposes [31].
3.
Using AWS Code Pipeline for Continuous Delivery:
◦
AWS Code Pipeline is used to automate the deployment process whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository [32, 33].
◦
A Code Pipeline is created in the AWS Management Console [33].
◦
The pipeline's source stage is configured to connect to your GitHub repository and specific branch (e.g., main) [33, 42].
◦
A deploy stage is added, configured to deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, specifying the application and environment names [42].
◦
(Optional) A build stage using AWS Code Build can be added for more complex build steps before deployment [42].
◦
Once the pipeline is set up, pushing code changes to the linked GitHub branch triggers the pipeline, which automatically pulls the latest code and deploys it to the configured Elastic Beanstalk environment [32, 34].
4.
Manual Deployment via Elastic Beanstalk Console: Alternatively, you can package your code (as a ZIP file containing the project structure, including .ebextensions) and upload it directly to your Elastic Beanstalk application environment via the AWS Management Console [33].
Version Control
Git and GitHub are used for version control [15, 29].
•
git init: Initializes a local Git repository [15].
•
git add .: Adds all new and modified files to the staging area [15, 43].
•
git commit -m "message": Commits staged changes with a descriptive message [15, 43].
•
git remote add origin <repository_url>: Connects the local repository to a remote GitHub repository [15, 44].
•
git push -u origin main: Pushes committed changes from the local main branch to the remote origin repository [15, 44].
•
git pull: Fetches and integrates changes from the remote repository [20].
The .gitignore file is configured to exclude environment files (venv) and the artifacts directory, as these are either environment-specific or generated during the pipeline execution and not necessary to track in the repository [15, 20, 21].
Exception Handling and Logging
•
Custom Exception Handling: A custom CustomException class is implemented in exception.py to capture detailed error information, making debugging easier [2, 13].
•
Logging: A logging setup in logger.py directs application logs (including informational messages and errors) to a timestamped log file within a logs folder, aiding in monitoring and troubleshooting [2, 14]. Logging is integrated into the components to track the flow of execution [8, 15].
Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning, specifically using Grid Search CV, is integrated into the model_trainer.py to find the optimal parameters for the machine learning models, aiming to improve performance [15, 28]. Model parameters are defined within the code, but could be moved to a configuration file (like YAML) for better management [28].
Utility Functions
The utils.py file contains helpful functions, such as save_object and load_object, which are used across different components (e.g., in data transformation and model training/prediction) to save and load Python objects (like the preprocessor and trained model) using pickle [4, 15, 37].
